{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  Consider a parallel program with three tasks (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3) having the following execution times (in milliseconds) on two different types of processors:\n\n| Task   | Processor Type A | Processor Type B |\n| :----- | :---------------- | :---------------- |\n| Task 1 | 20                | 15                |\n| Task 2 | 10                | 25                |\n| Task 3 | 15                | 10                |\n\nThere are dependencies between the tasks: Task 2 must complete before Task 3 can begin.  Task 1 can run concurrently with Task 2.\n\na)  If you have only one processor of Type A, what is the total execution time?\n\nb)  If you have one processor of Type A and one processor of Type B, what is the minimum total execution time achievable, and how would you assign the tasks to the processors?  Show your work.\n\nc) If you can use any combination of processors of Type A and Type B, what is the minimum number of processors needed to achieve the shortest execution time?  Justify your answer and show the task assignment.\n\n\n2.  A multicore processor has four cores, each capable of executing two threads concurrently (hyperthreading).  The processor executes a program consisting of several processes. Each process contains a single thread. The operating system's scheduler assigns threads to cores based on availability.\n\na) What is the maximum number of processes that can run concurrently on this multicore processor, assuming perfect scheduling efficiency? Explain your reasoning.\n\nb) Now, consider a scenario where each process needs to access a shared resource that can only handle one process at a time.  How would this limitation affect the maximum number of processes that can execute efficiently?  Explain your reasoning, and explain what type of overhead could result.  What would likely need to be added to the program to ensure that the shared resource is used efficiently?\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1819,"candidatesTokenCount":415,"totalTokenCount":2234,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":529},{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":415}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[50,50],"subject":"CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751411109423.pdf"}}
