{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  A parallel program consists of three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.  Their execution times are as follows:\n\n| Task     | Execution Time (seconds) |\n| -------- | ------------------------ |\n| Task 1   | 5                         |\n| Task 2   | 10                        |\n| Task 3   | 15                        |\n\nTask 2 depends on Task 1 completing, and Task 3 depends on both Task 1 and Task 2 completing.  You have two types of processors available:\n\n*   **Processor Type A:** Executes each task in the time specified in the table above.\n*   **Processor Type B:** Executes each task in half the time specified in the table above.\n\na)  If you use only Processor Type A, what is the minimum execution time (span) for this program?  Clearly show the execution schedule.\n\nb)  If you can use a combination of Processor Types A and B (any number of each), what is the minimum execution time achievable?  Clearly show your processor assignment for each task and calculate the speedup compared to using only Processor Type A.\n\n\n\n2.  Consider a single-core processor with superscalar capabilities and speculative execution.  The processor can execute up to two instructions per cycle.  The following instructions are to be executed:\n\n| Instruction | Type      | Cycles | Dependencies |\n| ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------- |\n| I1         | Integer    | 1      | None          |\n| I2         | Floating   | 2      | I1            |\n| I3         | Integer    | 1      | I1            |\n| I4         | Floating   | 2      | I2, I3        |\n\n\na) Assuming perfect instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is achieved and ignoring any pipeline hazards or branch prediction penalties, determine the total number of cycles required to execute all four instructions.  Show the execution schedule illustrating which instructions are executed in each cycle.\n\n\nb) Now suppose that speculative execution is disabled.  Calculate the minimum number of cycles needed to execute these instructions in this case.  Again, show the execution schedule.  What is the speedup from enabling speculative execution?\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1819,"candidatesTokenCount":476,"totalTokenCount":2295,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290},{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":529}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":476}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[50,50],"subject":"CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751411168917.pdf"}}
