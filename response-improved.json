{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  **Superscalar and Hyperthreading:**  A single-core processor has the following characteristics:\n\n    *   Superscalar capability: Can execute two instructions per cycle.\n    *   Speculative execution: Enabled.\n    *   Hyperthreading: Disabled.\n\n    Classify this processor architecture using the SISD, SIMD, MISD, or MIMD classifications.  Justify your answer in one sentence.\n\n\n2.  **MPI Communication:** Four processes (P0, P1, P2, P3) each have an integer array `A` initialized as follows:\n\n    *   P0: `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n    *   P1: `A = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n    *   P2: `A = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`\n    *   P3: `A = [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]`\n\n    Write a single MPI command that, when executed by all four processes, results in process P0 having `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and all other processes having `A = [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]`.\n\n\n3. **Parallel Task Scheduling:** Consider a parallel algorithm with three tasks (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3) with the following execution times:\n\n    | Task   | Execution Time (seconds) |\n    |--------|-------------------------|\n    | Task 1 | 5                        |\n    | Task 2 | 10                       |\n    | Task 3 | 15                       |\n\n    There are no dependencies between tasks.  If you have two processing cores available, what is the optimal schedule to minimize overall execution time? Show your schedule (which task runs on which core) and calculate the total execution time.\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1819,"candidatesTokenCount":438,"totalTokenCount":2257,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":529},{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":438}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[30,35,35],"subject":"CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751410684574.pdf"}}
