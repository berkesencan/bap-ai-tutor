{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  A single-core processor has two types of instructions: floating-point and integer.  Floating-point instructions take 20 cycles to execute, while integer instructions take 5 cycles.  A program consists of 100 floating-point instructions and 200 integer instructions.  What is the CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) for this program? What would be the execution time in nanoseconds if the clock frequency is 2 GHz?\n\n2.  We have a multicore processor with 4 cores.  Each core can execute two threads concurrently (hyperthreading).  Two processes, Process A and Process B, are to be run on this processor. Process A uses 3 threads, while Process B uses 2 threads. What is the maximum number of threads that can be running concurrently on the processor at any given time?  Explain your reasoning.\n\n3.  Consider a parallel program with three tasks (Task X, Task Y, Task Z).  Their execution times are as follows:\n\n| Task | Execution Time (seconds) |\n|---|---|\n| Task X | 5 |\n| Task Y | 10 |\n| Task Z | 15 |\n\nThe tasks have the following dependencies: Task Y cannot start until Task X completes, and Task Z cannot start until both Task X and Task Y complete.  What is the minimum time required to complete all three tasks if you have available 3 processors?  Show your reasoning and task scheduling.\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1789,"candidatesTokenCount":307,"totalTokenCount":2096,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290},{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":499}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":307}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[25,35,40],"subject":"Mathematics","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751410194198.pdf"}}
