Our Master Theorem: The version of the Master Theorem that we covered in class is on the last page of this homework. We won’t be covering the version of the Master Theorem in the textbook and you’re not responsible for knowing it. (But you may find it interesting!)

Reminder: For $r \neq 1$, $r^0 + r^1 + \dots + r^k = \frac{r^{k+1} - 1}{r - 1}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each example, indicate whether $f = o(g)$ (little-oh), $f = \omega(g)$ (little-omega), or $f = \Theta(g)$ (big-Theta). No justification is necessary.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(n) = n^2 \log n$, $g(n) = n^3$
        \item $f(n) = 2^n$, $g(n) = n^2$
        \item $f(n) = n \log n$, $g(n) = n \log(n^2)$
        \item $f(n) = 7n + 10$, $g(n) = n$
        \item $f(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n i^2$, $g(n) = n^3$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Give a formal proof of the following statement: If $f(n) \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $g(n) \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$, and $g(n)$ is unbounded (meaning $\lim_{n \to \infty} g(n) = \infty$) then $\log_2 f(n) = \Omega(\log g(n))$.
    Use the formal definition of big-Omega in your answer. In your proof, you can use the fact that the value of $\log_2 n$ increases as $n$ increases.
    \item For each of the following recurrences, determine whether Our Master Theorem (on the last page of this HW) can be applied to the recurrence. If it can, use it to give the solution to the recurrence in $\Theta$ notation; no need to give any details. If not, write “Our Master Theorem does not apply.”
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \log n$
        \item $T(n) = 9T(n/3) + n^2$
        \item $T(n) = T(n-1) + 1$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Our Master Theorem can be applied to a recurrence of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + n^d$, where $a, b, d$ are constants with $a > 0$, $b > 1$, $d > 0$. Consider instead a recurrence of the form $T_{new}(n) = aT_{new}(n/b) + n \log n$ where $a > 0$, $b > 1$.
    For each of the following, state whether the given property of $T_{new}$ is true. If so, explain why it is true. If not, explain why it is not true. (Even if you know the version of the Master Theorem in the textbook, don’t use it in your explanation.)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T_{new}(n) = O(n^2)$ if $\log_b a < 1$
        \item $T_{new}(n) = \Omega(n \log^2 n)$ if $\log_b a = 1$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider the recurrence $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n$ for $n > 1$, and $T(1) = 1$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Compute the value of $T(4)$, using the recurrence. Show your work.
        \item Use a recursion tree to solve the recurrence and get a closed-form expression for $T(n)$, when $n$ is a power of 2. (Check that your expression is correct by plugging in $n = 4$ and comparing with your answer to (a).)
        \item Suppose that the base case is $T(2) = 3$, instead of $T(1) = 1$. What is the solution to the recurrence in this case, for $n \geq 2$?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider a variation of mergesort that works as follows: If the array has size 1, return. Otherwise, divide the array into fourths, rather than in half. Recursively sort each fourth using this variation of mergesort. Then merge the first two fourths. Then merge the last two fourths. Finally, merge the two merged pairs.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write a recurrence for the running time of this variation of mergesort. It should be similar to the recurrence for ordinary mergesort. Assume $n$ is a power of 4.
        \item Apply Our Master Theorem to the recurrence to get the running time of the algorithm, in theta notation. Show your work.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consider a recursive algorithm that operates as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the input size is less than or equal to 1, return 1.
        \item Recursively call itself on two subproblems, each of size n/2.
        \item Perform some operation that takes O(n log n) time.
        \item Combine the results of the recursive calls in O(1) time.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write a recurrence relation for the running time T(n) of this algorithm.
        \item Solve the recurrence relation using the Master Theorem, or explain why the Master Theorem is inapplicable.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  Let $f(n) = n^2$ and $g(n) = n \log n$. Determine whether $f(n) = O(g(n))$, $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$, or $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$. Justify your answer using the formal definitions.
    \item  Consider the recurrence $T(n) = 3T(n/3) + n$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Solve the recurrence using the Master Theorem.
        \item Draw a recursion tree for T(9) and verify your solution from (a).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the maximum and minimum elements in an unsorted array of size n. Write a recurrence relation for its running time and solve the recurrence using the Master Theorem or an appropriate method.  State the time complexity in Big-Theta notation.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Theorem 0.1 (Our Master Theorem)}
Let $a, b, d, n_0$ be constants such that $a > 0$, $b > 1$, $d \geq 0$ and $n_0 > 0$.
Let $T(n) = aT(n/b) + \Theta(n^d)$ for when $n \geq n_0$, and $T(n) = \Theta(1)$ when $0 \leq n < n_0$. Then,
\[
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    \Theta(n^d \log n) & \text{if } d = \log_b a \\
    \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) & \text{if } d < \log_b a \\
    \Theta(n^d) & \text{if } d > \log_b a
\end{cases}
\]
We assume here that $T(n)$ is a function defined on the natural numbers. We use $aT(n/b)$ to mean $a' T(\lfloor n/b \rfloor) + a'' T(\lceil n/b \rceil)$ where $a', a'' > 0$ such that $a' + a'' = a$.
