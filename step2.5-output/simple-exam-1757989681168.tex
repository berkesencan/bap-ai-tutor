\textbf{Our Master Theorem:} The version of the Master Theorem that we covered in class is on the last page of this homework. We won’t be covering the version of the Master Theorem in the textbook and you’re not responsible for knowing it. (But you may find it interesting!)

Reminder: For $r \neq 1$, $\sum_{i=0}^{k} r^i = \frac{r^{k+1}-1}{r-1}$.

\section*{1. Big-O Notation}

For each example, indicate whether $f = o(g)$ (little-oh), $f = \omega(g)$ (little-omega), or $f = \Theta(g)$ (big-Theta). No justification is necessary.

(a) $f(n) = 2n^2 + 5n$, $g(n) = n^2$
(b) $f(n) = \log_2 n$, $g(n) = n$
(c) $f(n) = n!$, $g(n) = 2^n$
(d) $f(n) = 7 \sum_{i=0}^n 2^i$, $g(n) = 2^n$
(e) $f(n) = \log_2 n$, $g(n) = \log_{10} n$


\section*{2. Logarithmic Big-O}

Give a formal proof of the following statement: If $f(n) \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $g(n) \geq 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f(n) = O(g(n))$, and $g(n)$ is unbounded (meaning $\lim_{n \to \infty} g(n) = \infty$) then $\log_3 f(n) = O(\log_3 g(n))$.

Use the formal definition of big-Oh in your answer. In your proof, you can use the fact that the value of $\log_3 n$ increases as $n$ increases.

Note that a similar statement with exponential functions is not true: If $f(n) = 5^n$ and $g(n) = n$, then $f(n) = O(g(n))$, but $3^{5^n}$ is not $O(3^n)$.


\section*{3. Master Theorem Application}

For each of the following recurrences, determine whether Our Master Theorem (on the last page of this HW) can be applied to the recurrence. If it can, use it to give the solution to the recurrence in $\Theta$ notation; no need to give any details. If not, write “Our Master Theorem does not apply.”

(a) $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \log n$
(b) $T(n) = 9T(n/3) + n^2$
(c) $T(n) = T(n/2) + 1$


\section*{4. Modified Master Theorem}

Our Master Theorem can be applied to a recurrence of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + n^d$, where $a, b, d$ are constants with $a > 0$, $b > 1$, $d > 0$. Consider instead a recurrence of the form $T_{new}(n) = aT_{new}(n/b) + n \log_d n$ where $a > 0$, $b > 1$, $d > 1$ (and $T(1) = 1$).

For each of the following, state whether the given property of $T_{new}$ is true. If so, explain why it is true. If not, explain why it is not true. (Even if you know the version of the Master Theorem in the textbook, don’t use it in your explanation.)

(a) $T_{new}(n) = O(n^2)$ if $\log_b a = 2$
(b) $T_{new}(n) = \Omega(n \log n)$


\section*{5. Recurrence Relation}

Consider the recurrence $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \log n$ for $n > 1$, and $T(1) = 1$.

(a) Compute the value of $T(4)$, using the recurrence. Show your work.
(b) Use a recursion tree to get an approximate closed-form expression for $T(n)$, when $n$ is a power of 2. (Check that your expression is approximately correct by plugging in $n = 4$ and comparing with your answer to (a).)
(c) Suppose that the base case is $T(2) = 5$, instead of $T(1) = 1$. What is the solution to the recurrence in this case, for $n \geq 2$?


\section*{6. Quaternary Mergesort}

Consider a variation of mergesort that works as follows: If the array has size 1, return. Otherwise, divide the array into fourths, rather than in half. Recursively sort each fourth using this variation of mergesort. Then merge the first (leftmost) fourth with the second fourth. Then merge the result with the third fourth. Finally, merge the result with the last fourth.

(a) Write a recurrence for the running time of this variation of mergesort. It should be similar to the recurrence for ordinary mergesort. Assume $n$ is a power of 4.
(b) Apply Our Master Theorem to the recurrence to get the running time of the algorithm, in theta notation. Show your work.


\section*{7. Unusual Recursive Sorting Algorithm (2)}

Consider the following recursive sorting algorithm. Assume $n$ is a power of 2. (Note: This is not a version of mergesort. No merges are performed.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the array has only one element, return.
    \item Recursively sort the first half of the elements in the array.
    \item Recursively sort the last half of the elements in the array.
    \item Recursively sort the first half of the elements in the array again.
\end{itemize}
(Note: Even if you can’t figure out part (a) below, you can still answer (b) and (c).)

(a) Prove that the algorithm is correct by showing that the array will be sorted after the three recursive calls are performed, assuming the three recursive calls correctly sort their (sub)arrays. Note that the middle third of the array is included in each of the 3 recursive calls.  This algorithm is incorrect; explain why.
(b) Write a recurrence expressing the running time of the algorithm.
(c) Apply Our Master Theorem to your recurrence. What is the running time of the algorithm, in theta notation?


\section*{8.  Analyzing a Different Recurrence}

Consider the recurrence $T(n) = 3T(n/2) + n^2$ for $n > 1$, and $T(1) = 1$.

(a) Use the recursion tree method to find a guess for the closed-form solution of the recurrence.
(b) Use the substitution method to prove your guess is correct, up to big-Theta notation.


\section*{Our Master Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $a, b, d, n_0$ be constants such that $a > 0$, $b > 1$, $d \geq 0$ and $n_0 > 0$.
Let $T(n) = aT(n/b) + \Theta(n^d)$ for when $n \geq n_0$, and $T(n) = \Theta(1)$ when $0 \leq n < n_0$. Then,
\[
T(n) = \begin{cases}
\Theta(n^d \log n) & \text{if } d = \log_b a \\
\Theta(n^{\log_b a}) & \text{if } d < \log_b a \\
\Theta(n^d) & \text{if } d > \log_b a
\end{cases}
\]
We assume here that $T(n)$ is a function defined on the natural numbers. We use $aT(n/b)$ to mean $a'T(\lfloor n/b \rfloor) + a''T(\lceil n/b \rceil)$ where $a', a'' > 0$ such that $a' + a'' = a$.
