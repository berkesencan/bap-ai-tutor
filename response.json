{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"Here are five practice questions based on the provided PDF, following all specified requirements:\n\n\n1. **Superscalar and Hyperthreading:**  A single-core processor has the following features: superscalar capability (executes two instructions per cycle), speculative execution (predicts branch outcomes), and hyperthreading (two logical cores).  If each instruction takes one clock cycle to execute, and each logical core runs independent instructions, what is the maximum number of instructions that can be completed in 10 clock cycles?\n\n\n2. **MPI_Bcast Communication:** Four processes (P0, P1, P2, P3) each have an integer array `A` initialized as follows: P0: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, P1: {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, P2: {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, P3: {16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. Write a single MPI_Bcast command that will ensure all processes have a copy of the array from process P1. Assume MPI_COMM_WORLD is used.\n\n\n3. **Task Scheduling and Speedup:** Consider a task flow graph with tasks A, B, C, and D.  Task A takes 5 time units, B takes 10, C takes 15, and D takes 5.  B depends on A, C depends on B, and D depends on A.  We have two core types: Type 1 (10 time units/task), Type 2 (5 time units/task). What is the minimum number of cores (of either type) required to minimize the total execution time?  Show your task assignment to the cores, and calculate the total time.\n\n\n4. **MIPS Calculation:** Two implementations of an algorithm are compared. Implementation 1 has 1,000,000 instructions, 50% floating-point (10 cycles/instruction), 50% integer (1 cycle/instruction). Implementation 2 has 2,000,000 instructions, all integer.  Both are run on a single-core 2 GHz processor. Calculate the MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) for each implementation.\n\n\n5. **SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD Classification:** Classify each of the following processor designs as SISD, SIMD, MISD, or MIMD:\n\n   a) A single-core processor with superscalar execution but without hyperthreading or speculative execution.\n   b) A multi-core processor where each core executes the same instructions on different data sets simultaneously.\n   c) A processor with multiple cores, each executing a different program independently.\n   d) A hypothetical processor that can execute multiple instructions at once, but only if all are the same.\n\n\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1789,"candidatesTokenCount":613,"totalTokenCount":2402,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":499},{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":613}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[20,20,20,20,20],"subject":"Mathematics","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751410050303.pdf"}}
