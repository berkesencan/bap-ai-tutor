CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing
Midterm Exam (Mar 14th, 2024)
Total: 100 points
Important Notes- READ BEFORE SOLVING THE
EXAM
• If you perceive any ambiguity in any of the questions, state your assumptions clearly and solve the
problem based on your assumptions. We will grade
both your solutions and your assumptions.
• This exam is take-home.
• The exam is posted on Brightspace, at the beginning of the March 14th lecture (2pm EST).
• You have up to 24 hours to submit on Brightspace
(i.e. till March 15th 2pm EST), in the same way
as you submit an assignment. However, unlike assignments, you can only submit once.
• Your answers must be very focused. You may be
penalized for giving wrong answers and for putting
irrelevant information in your answers.
• Your answer sheet must be organized as follows:
– The very first page of your answer must contain
only:
∗ Your Last Name
∗ Your First Name
∗ Your NetID
∗ Copy and paste the honor code shown in the
rectangle at the bottom of this page.
– In your answer sheet, answer one problem per
page. The exam has four main problems, each
one must be answered in a separate page.

• This exam consists of 4 problems, with a total of
100 points.
• Your answers can be typed or written by hand
(but with clear handwriting). It is up to you. But
you must upload one pdf file containing all your
answers.
Honor code (copy and paste to the first page of your
exam)
• You may use the textbook, slides, the class recorded
lectures, the information in the discussion forums
of the class on Brightspace, and any notes you
have. But you may not use the internet.
• You may NOT use communication tools to collaborate with other humans. This includes but is not
limited to Google-Chat, Messenger, E-mail, etc.
• You cannot use LLMs such as chatGPT, Gemini,
Bard, etc.
• Do not try to search for answers on the internet,
it will show in your answer, and you will earn an
immediate grade of 0.
• Anyone found sharing answers, communicating with
another student, searching the internet, or using
prohibited tools (as mentioned above) during the
exam period will earn an immediate grade of 0.
• “I understand the ground rules and agree to abide
by them. I will not share answers or assist another
student during this exam, nor will I seek assistance
from another student or attempt to view their answers.”

Problem 1 [30 points] A parallel program uses
MPI Send and MPI Recv to exchange data between two
processes, P0 and P1. Process P0 sends a 10-element
integer array data to P1 using MPI Send(&data, 10,
MPI INT, 1, 100, MPI COMM WORLD);. Process P1
receives the data using MPI Recv(&received data, 10,
MPI INT, 0, 100, MPI COMM WORLD, &status);. If data
initially contains the values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10}, and no errors occur:
a) What are the contents of received data in P1
after the communication?
b) What is the purpose of the tag (100) in both
MPI Send and MPI Recv? Explain its importance for
reliable communication.

Problem 2 [35 points] Consider a shared-memory
multiprocessor system with 4 cores. Three
independent tasks, Task A, Task B, and Task C,
have execution times of 20, 15, and 25 milliseconds,
respectively. If each core can run one task at a time,
and we assign one task per core, answer the
following:
a) What is the total execution time of these three
tasks?
b) Assume now that Task A can be split into 2
sub-tasks (A1 and A2) each taking 10ms to execute.
What is the minimum execution time if you divide
Task A into subtasks and assign them across the
cores? Show your task assignment and explain your
reasoning.

Problem 3 [35 points] Suppose we have a 2-way
hyperthreading core. We want to execute two
threads, Thread X and Thread Y. Thread X
performs 100 floating-point operations, and Thread
Y performs 50 integer operations. Assuming that
floating-point operations are twice as expensive (in
terms of CPU cycles) as integer operations:
a) Does this necessarily lead to load imbalance if we
run both threads concurrently? Explain why or why
not.
b) How could you improve the performance by
adjusting the workload if load imbalance exists?
Describe a possible solution and explain the benefits.
