{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  **Superscalar and Hyperthreading:**  A single-core processor has the following characteristics:  it supports superscalar execution (can execute multiple instructions per cycle), but *does not* support speculative execution or hyperthreading.  Classify this processor architecture using the SISD, SIMD, MISD, or MIMD classifications.  Justify your answer in one sentence.\n\n\n2. **MPI Communication:** Two processes, Process 0 and Process 1, each have an array of integers:\n\n   Process 0: `int A[3] = {1, 2, 3};`\n   Process 1: `int B[3] = {4, 5, 6};`\n\n   Write the minimal MPI code snippet (using MPI_Send and MPI_Recv) that ensures Process 0 receives array B from Process 1 and Process 1 receives array A from Process 0.  Assume MPI_COMM_WORLD is used for communication.  You do not need to include error handling.\n\n\n3. **Parallel Task Scheduling:** Consider a parallel task graph with three tasks (A, B, C) and the following dependencies:  A must complete before B can start, and B must complete before C can start.  Task execution times are as follows:\n\n   | Task | Execution Time (seconds) |\n   |---|---|\n   | A | 5 |\n   | B | 10 |\n   | C | 5 |\n\n   a)  If you have two processors available, what is the shortest possible execution time for completing all three tasks? Show your task scheduling.\n\n   b) What is the speedup achieved compared to executing the tasks sequentially on a single processor?  Show your calculation.\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1819,"candidatesTokenCount":363,"totalTokenCount":2182,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290},{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":529}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":363}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[35,35,30],"subject":"CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751411310758.pdf"}}
