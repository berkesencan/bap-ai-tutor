Determine the asymptotic relationship between f(n) = n log n and g(n) = n<sup>1.5</sup>.


\vspace{0.3cm}
Prove or disprove: If f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) is unbounded, then 2<sup>f(n)</sup> = O(2<sup>g(n)</sup>).


\vspace{0.3cm}
Solve the recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n log n using the Master Theorem or a recursion tree method.  Show your work and state any assumptions.


\vspace{0.3cm}
What is the value of T(16) if T(n) = T(n/4) + 1 for n > 1 and T(1) = 1?


\vspace{0.3cm}
Explain why the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n is solvable using the Master Theorem, but T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n log n is not.


\vspace{0.3cm}
Which of the following is NOT a correct asymptotic relationship?


\vspace{0.3cm}
Design a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the maximum and minimum elements in an unsorted array. Write a recurrence relation for its running time and solve it using the Master Theorem.


\vspace{0.3cm}
Give an example of a recurrence relation that has a solution of Θ(n log log n).


\vspace{0.3cm}
Prove that if f(n) = Θ(g(n)), then f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)).


\vspace{0.3cm}
What is the difference between big-O, big-Omega, and big-Theta notation in the context of algorithm analysis?
