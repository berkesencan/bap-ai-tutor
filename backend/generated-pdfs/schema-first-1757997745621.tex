\section*{Problem 1} \hfill [20 points]

A program uses multiple threads to process a large dataset.  Each thread independently processes a portion of the data. Which parallel programming model is BEST suited for this scenario?

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.3cm}
\item Shared memory
\item Message Passing Interface (MPI)
\item Distributed shared memory
\item None of the above
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 3} \hfill [40 points]

Consider a parallel algorithm designed to sort a large array of integers.  Describe a suitable algorithm (e.g., merge sort, quicksort adapted for parallelism) and discuss its performance characteristics in terms of scalability and communication overhead.  What are the potential bottlenecks, and how could they be mitigated?
