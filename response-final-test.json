{"success":true,"data":{"questions":{"text":"1.  A parallel program consists of three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.  Their execution times on a single core are as follows:\n\n| Task | Execution Time (seconds) |\n|---|---|\n| Task 1 | 5 |\n| Task 2 | 10 |\n| Task 3 | 15 |\n\nTasks 1 and 2 can be executed concurrently, but Task 3 depends on both Task 1 and Task 2 completing.  You have access to a multi-core processor with four identical cores.  \n\na)  Draw a task dependency graph illustrating the relationships between the three tasks.\nb)  Determine the minimum execution time if all three tasks are run on this four-core processor. Show your reasoning, including task assignment to cores and the total execution time calculation.  \n\n\n2.  You are given a simple multicore system with two types of cores:  Type A and Type B. Each core can execute one task at a time.  You have two tasks, Task X and Task Y, with the following execution times:\n\n| Task | Type A Execution Time (ms) | Type B Execution Time (ms) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Task X | 20 | 30 |\n| Task Y | 10 | 15 |\n\nThere are two Type A cores and one Type B core available.\n\na) What is the minimum execution time to complete both tasks using this system?  Show your work, including the task assignments to cores.\nb)  Assume that Task X and Task Y are independent (no dependencies). What is the speedup achieved compared to a single Type A core?  Show your calculation.\n","usageMetadata":{"promptTokenCount":1819,"candidatesTokenCount":361,"totalTokenCount":2180,"promptTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":529},{"modality":"DOCUMENT","tokenCount":1290}],"candidatesTokensDetails":[{"modality":"TEXT","tokenCount":361}]}},"parsedQuestions":[],"questionPoints":[50,50],"subject":"CSCI-UA.0480-051: Parallel Computing","difficulty":"medium","pdfPath":"/Users/berkesencan/Desktop/bap-ai-tutor-main/backend/uploads/practice-exam-1751410757382.pdf"}}
