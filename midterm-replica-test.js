Midterm Exam (March 9th, 2023)

Total: 100 points

Problem 1 (25 points)

Consider the following table showing processor features and their capabilities:

| Feature | Maximum Number of Processes/Threads | Maximum Number of Cores |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Only Pipelining | 1 | 1 |
| Superscalar (4 execution units) | 1 | 1 |
| 2-way Hyperthreading | 2 | 1 |
| 4-core CPU | 4 | 4 |
| 8-core CPU with Hyperthreading | 16 | 8 |

a. [8 points] Explain the difference between processes and threads in the context of these processor features. How does hyperthreading enable multiple threads per core?

b. [12 points] Compare the performance characteristics of each feature. Which feature would provide the best speedup for CPU-bound parallel workloads? Justify your answer.

c. [5 points] If you had to choose between a 4-core CPU without hyperthreading and a 2-core CPU with hyperthreading for parallel computing, which would you choose and why?

Problem 2 (40 points)

Suppose we have the following DAG that represents different tasks and their dependencies:

\`\`\`
       A(5)
      /    \\
   B(10)   C(15)
     |      |
   D(20)   E(8)
     |      |
      \\    /
       F(12)
\`\`\`

The numbers in parentheses represent execution times in seconds.

The following table shows the execution time of each task if we execute it on different CPU types:

| Task | CPU type A | CPU type B | CPU type C |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| A    | 5          | 4          | 6          |
| B    | 10         | 8          | 12         |
| C    | 15         | 18         | 12         |
| D    | 20         | 16         | 24         |
| E    | 8          | 10         | 6          |
| F    | 12         | 14         | 10         |

a. [15 points] What is the minimum number of CPUs of each type that we need to get the highest speedup over sequential execution on CPU type A? Show which CPU will execute which task(s) and calculate the final speedup.

b. [15 points] Repeat part (a), but using CPU type B instead of CPU type A as the baseline for sequential execution.

c. [10 points] A program uses multiple threads to perform computation. Does increasing the number of shared variables always lead to better performance through better data sharing? Explain why or why not, considering synchronization overhead.

Problem 3 (35 points)

Consider parallel algorithm analysis and performance evaluation.

a. [10 points] Define parallel efficiency and explain its importance in evaluating parallel algorithms. What factors can cause parallel efficiency to decrease as the number of processors increases?

b. [15 points] A parallel sorting algorithm achieves the following execution times:
   - Sequential: 120 seconds
   - 2 processors: 65 seconds  
   - 4 processors: 35 seconds
   - 8 processors: 22 seconds
   
   Calculate the speedup and parallel efficiency for each configuration. What can you conclude about the scalability of this algorithm?

c. [10 points] Explain Amdahl's Law and how it limits the maximum speedup achievable by parallel processing. If a program has 20% sequential code, what is the theoretical maximum speedup possible with unlimited processors?
